# Blender 4.5 Updated Pie Menus addon (space_view3d_pie_menus)

A collection of pie menu addons for Blender 4.5+ that have been updated from legacy versions that worked in much older Blender releases.

## Overview

This repository contains pie menu addons that were originally designed for older versions of Blender and have been **updated by me** to work with **Blender 4.5**. 

Since official Blender developers take forever to update these addons (if they ever do), this repository serves as a quality-of-life improvement for the community. You can use these updated versions while waiting for official updates that may never come.

**Main focus**: The **Origin Pie** menu works perfectly (origin to bottom) - that's what matters most to me and hopefully to you too.

**Disclaimer**: I can't guarantee everything works in every scenario, but it works for my workflow. Your mileage may vary.

## Installation

### Simple ZIP Installation

1. **Download** the `space_view3d_pie_menus.zip`  file from this repository or zip it yourself
2. **Open Blender 4.5**
3. Go to `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Add-ons`
4. Click `Install...`
5. **Select** the downloaded ZIP file
6. **Enable** the addon by checking the checkbox next to "3D Viewport Pie Menus"

That's it! No manual folder copying required.

## Compatibility

| Blender Version | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 4.5+ | Updated for compatibility |

## Important Notes

- **Personal Update**: This is my own compatibility update, not an official release
- **Works For Me**: Tested in my workflow, but I can't test every possible use case
- **Community Effort**: Use it while waiting for official developers to catch up (don't hold your breath)
- **No Guarantees**: Some features might not work perfectly in all scenarios
- **Origin Pie Priority**: The Origin Pie menu is the main focus and works reliably
