# Blender 4.5 Updated old 3D Viewport Pie Menus (space_view3d_pie_menus)

A collection of old pie menu addons for Blender 4.5+ that have been updated from legacy versions that worked in much older Blender releases.

**Note**: The **newer version** was removed from Blender but is still available on the [Blender Extensions platform](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/viewport-pie-menus/).

## Overview

**This repository contains other / older pie menu addon** that were originally designed for older versions of Blender and have been **updated by me** to work with **Blender 4.5**. 

This repository serves as a quality-of-life improvement for the community and as an old but updated alternative. You can use these updated versions or try the newest one with the official repository.

## Why Try the Old Pie Menus?

The newer version on Blender Extensions is more polished and has more functionality and settings. However, if you prefer the older, simpler version, here are reasons to try this one:

### **Why You Might Prefer This Version:**
- **Simpler Setup**: Less configuration options and settings to manage
- **Familiar Workflow**: If you're used to this exact version from older Blender releases  
- **Less Complex**: Fewer features means less things that can break or conflict
- **Backup Option**: Alternative if the Extensions version doesn't work for you

### **Important Disclaimer:**
**Some pie menus work properly, but I don't guarantee all of them will function correctly.** I'm primarily interested in a few specific ones (especially the **Origin Pie**), so other menus haven't been thoroughly tested. Use at your own risk.

**Bottom Line**: The new version has more features, but sometimes simpler is better - choose what fits your workflow.

**Main focus**: The **Origin Pie** menu works perfectly (origin to bottom) - that's what matters most to me and hopefully to you too.

**Disclaimer**: I can't guarantee everything works in every scenario, but it works for my workflow. Your mileage may vary.

## Installation

### Simple ZIP Installation

1. **Download** the `space_view3d_pie_menus.zip`  file from this repository or zip it yourself
2. **Open Blender 4.5**

4. Click `Install...`
5. **Select** the downloaded ZIP file

- **Community Effort**: Use it while waiting for official developers to catch up (don't hold your breath)
- **No Guarantees**: Some features might not work perfectly in all scenarios
- **Origin Pie Priority**: The Origin Pie menu is the main focus and works reliably
